# SmsRedirect-App

The App redirects the message received to the entered number using the default sim which is set for sending message. It also shows the sender's mobile no. and the message body. 

The App also consists of a service using which a user can forward the messages to a number in bacground. The app will work in background and will automatically send the sms.

In case if we don't enter the number to which the sms is to be redirected than in that case the app reply the sender with the same sms. (its optional and can be edited easily in code according to ur needs)
