# Note

Both the Apps were made during my internship with KGE Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

# SmsRedirect-App

The App redirects the message received to the entered number using the default sim which is set for sending message. It also shows the sender's mobile no. and the message body. 

The App also consists of a service using which a user can forward the messages to a number in bacground. The app will work in background and will automatically send the sms.

In case if we don't enter the number to which the sms is to be redirected than in that case the app reply the sender with the same sms. (its optional and can be edited easily in code according to ur needs)

Added the functionality of Simcard:- 
 
Whichever Simcard you select, only the messages received on that sim card will be redirected.

Please Note that the there 2 fields which need to be inputed by the user

 1. The user can enter the list of numbers seperated by "," to which the received SMS will be sent.
 2. This field user has to enter the simcard number, only from this number the sms will be read.
